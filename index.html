<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>The highschool that I attended was Amity Regional High School in Woodbridge, Connecticut. 
   I enjoyed my time there and I learned so much and I was definetly prepared for college. My
   hobbies are coding, basketball, video games, hiking, and just hanging out with friends in
   general. Being social is an important part of my life and I am happy that I am continuing 
   this in college too. </p>
